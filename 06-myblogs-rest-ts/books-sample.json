Create beautiful mobile apps with JavaScript and React Deliver high quality mobile apps, at light speed. Building the same app in both Swift and Java is time-consuming. With React Native, you can release a native app on both iOS and Android from a single codebase. Do you or your team already know JavaScript? Leverage your existing knowledge to build world class mobile applications. The React Native ecosystem is evolving fast. Get started on the right foot. With such an active community and so many updates, it feels impossible to know what's best and what's just noise. We cover the latest React Native version and best practices so you can develop with confidence. What You'll Build When you buy Fullstack React Native, you're not buying just a book, but dozens of code examples. Every chapter in the book comes with a complete project that uses the concepts in the chapter and provides support for both iOS (including iPhone X screens) & Android. A Weather App - Get your feet wet with React Native by building a weather app allows the user to input their location and grabs weather data from a third party API. A Time Tracker - Brush up on your core React knowledge and build a time tracking app. A Messaging App - Understand how to use the core React Native APIs like Geolocation, CameraRoll, Keyboard, NetInfo and much more through completing a messaging app An Instagram Clone - Learn how to style your app, manage user input, add comments and display photos from Unsplash A Contacts App - Learn how to use Navigation: a major piece of any mobile application with multiple screens A Puzzle Game - Learn how to achieve smooth animations that render at 60 frames-per-second (fps) FAQHow long is the book? The book has 11 chapters totaling 670 pages, several sample apps totaling over 1000+ lines of code (JavaScript/JSX, non-comment lines). Do I have to know React? Nope! We've written the book so that it can be used even if you aren't familiar with React. Although, if you'd like to learn React in depth, checkout our other book Fullstack React Do I have to know JavaScript? Yes, we assume you know the basics of the language. But you don't need to be completely up-to-date: we teach the latest language features in case you're not familiar with them. However, this book teaches React Native from the ground up and you can use it even if you've never written a mobile app before.",

No knowledge of React is needed, though a working knowledge of ES2015 will help you follow along better. What You Will Learn Craft reusable React components Control navigation using the React Router to help keep your UI in sync with URLs Build isomorphic web applications using Node.js Use the Flexbox layout model to create responsive mobile designs Leverage the native APIs of Android and iOS to build engaging applications with React Native Respond to gestures in a way that's intuitive for the user Use Relay to build a unified data architecture for your React UIs In Detail React and React Native allow you to build cross-platform desktop and mobile applications using Facebook's innovative UI libraries. Combined with the Flux data architecture and Relay, you can now create powerful and feature-complete applications from just one code base! This book is split into three parts. The first part shows you how to start crafting composable UIs using React, from rendering with JSX and creating reusable components through to routing and creating isomorphic applications that run on Node. We then move on to showing you how to take the concepts of React and apply them to building Native UIs using React Native. You'll find out how to build responsive and streamlined UIs that can properly handle user interactions in a mobile environment. You'll also learn how to access device-specific APIs such as the geolocation API, and how to handle offline development with React Native. Finally, we'll tie all of these skills together and shows you how you can create React applications that run on every major platform. As well as understanding application state in depth, you'll learn how to leverage Relay to make feature-complete, data-driven web and native mobile applications. Style and approach Split into three major sections to help organize your learning, this hands-on, code-first book will help you get up to speed with React and React Native—the UI framework that powers Netflix, Yahoo, and Facebook.",

If you already have some JavaScript knowledge or are using React on the web, then you will be able to quickly get up and running with React Native for iOS and Android. What You Will Learn Set up the React Native environment on both devices and emulators Gain an in-depth understanding of how React Native works behind the scenes Write your own custom native UI components Learn the ins and outs of screen navigation Master the art of layout and styles Work with device-exclusive data such as geolocation Develop native modules in Objective-C and Java that interact with JavaScript Test and deploy your application for a production-ready environment In Detail React Native is a game-changing approach to hybrid mobile development. Web developers can leverage their existing skills to write mobile applications in JavaScript that are truly native without using cross-compilation or web views. These applications have all of the advantages of those written in Objective-C or Java, combined with the rapid development cycle that JavaScript developers are accustomed to. Web developers who want to develop native mobile applications face a high barrier to entry, because they are forced to learn platform-specific languages and frameworks. Numerous hybrid technologies have tried to simplify this process, but have failed to achieve the performance and appearance that users expect. This book will show you all the advantages of true native development that React Native has without the steep learning curve, leveraging the knowledge you already have. We do this by getting you up and running quickly with a sample application. Next, we'll introduce you to the fundamentals of creating components and explain how React Native works under the hood. Once you have established a solid foundation, you will dive headfirst into developing a real-world application from start to finish. Along the way, we will demonstrate how to create multiple screens and navigate between them,use layout and style native UI components, and access native APIs such as local storage and geolocation. Finally, we tackle the advanced topic of Native modules, which demonstrates that there are truly no limits to what you can do with React Native. Style and approach This book provides a simple and easy way to build mobile applications in JavaScript. Each topic takes you through the life cycle of creating a fully-functional native app, with detailed explanations of the entire process.",

Get to know industry standard patterns as well as situational patterns. Decouple your application with these set of “Idea patterns”. Key FeaturesMobile development in React Native should be done in a reusable way. Learn how to build scalable applications using JavaScript patterns that are battle tested.Try effective techniques on your own using over 80 standalone examples.Book Description React Native helps developers reuse code across different mobile platforms like iOS and Android. This book will show you effective design patterns in the React Native world and will make you ready for professional development in big teams. The book will focus only on the patterns that are relevant to JavaScript, ECMAScript, React and React Native. However, you can successfully transfer a lot of the skills and techniques to other languages. I call them “Idea patterns”. This book will start with the most standard development patterns in React like component building patterns, styling patterns in React Native and then extend these patterns to your mobile application using real world practical examples. Each chapter comes with full, separate source code of applications that you can build and run on your phone. The book is also diving into architectural patterns. Especially how to adapt MVC to React environment. You will learn Flux architecture and how Redux is implementing it. Each approach will be presented with its pros and cons. You will learn how to work with external data sources using libraries like Redux thunk and Redux Saga. The end goal is the ability to recognize the best solution for a given problem for your next mobile application. What you will learnExplore the design Patterns in React NativeLearn the best practices for React Native developmentExplore common React patterns that are highly used within React Native developmentLearn to decouple components and use dependency injection in your applicationsExplore the best ways of fetching data from the backend systemsLearn the styling patterns and how to implement custom mobile designsExplore the best ways to organize your application code in big codebasesWho this book is for The ideal target audience for this book are people eager to learn React Native design patterns who already know the basics of JavaScript. We can assume that the target audience already knows how to write Hello World in JavaScript and know what are the functions, recursive functions, JavaScript types and loops.",

In this series of books we will overcome the problem of having to write code for Android and iOS by using React Native. React Native is a framework developed by Facebook for creating native-style apps for iOS & Android under one common language, JavaScript. Initially, Facebook only developed React Native to support iOS. However with its recent support of the Android operating system, the library can now render mobile UIs for both platforms. Why React Native ? Not only react native allows you to create cross platform applications but react native also makes updating apps simple through over-the-app updates. Over the air update in react native is achieved through technologies such as CodePush with a few lines of code. Armed with React Native you’ll finally be able to make apps of your choice in no time and I’m glad to show you what React Native can do through this series of books. In this book we will learn the core concepts of Javascript to help us with our React Native Journey.",
